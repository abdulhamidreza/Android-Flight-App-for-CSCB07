CSCB07 Project Phase 1: the Database

All data will be stored in 3 CSV files: client.csv, admin.csv, and flight.csv.

client.csv will store all the clients data, with one client per line, in this form:

email, password, firstName, lastName, address, creditCard, first flight ID, second flight ID, ... last flight ID

admin.csv will store all admins data, with one admin per line, in this form:

email, password

flight.csv will store all flight data, with one flight per line, in this form:

flightID, arrivalTime, departTime, origin, destination, airline, availableSeats, flightTime, cost

The data will be accessed using a class called Database. It will have methods to add new data, and update the old data in the database. 

All this data will be loaded when the app is started, and updated when the update methods from the Database class are called.
